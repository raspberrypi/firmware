Introduction
============

This directory contains Device Tree overlays. Device Tree makes it possible
to support many hardware configurations with a single kernel and without the
need to explicitly load or blacklist kernel modules. Note that this isn't a
"pure" Device Tree configuration (c.f. MACH_BCM2835) - some on-board devices
are still configured by the board support code, but the intention is to
eventually reach that goal.

On Raspberry Pi, Device Tree usage is controlled from /boot/config.txt. By
default, the Raspberry Pi kernel boots with device tree enabled. You can
completely disable DT usage (for now) by adding:

    device_tree=

to your config.txt, which should cause your Pi to revert to the old way of
doing things after a reboot.

In /boot you will find a .dtb for each base platform. This describes the
hardware that is part of the Raspberry Pi board. The loader (start.elf and its
siblings) selects the .dtb file appropriate for the platform by name, and reads
it into memory. At this point, all of the optional interfaces (i2c, i2s, spi)
are disabled, but they can be enabled using Device Tree parameters:

    dtparam=i2c=on,i2s=on,spi=on

However, this shouldn't be necessary in many use cases because loading an
overlay that requires one of those interfaces will cause it to be enabled
automatically, and it is advisable to only enable interfaces if they are
needed.

Configuring additional, optional hardware is done using Device Tree overlays
(see below).

raspi-config
============

The Advanced Options section of the raspi-config utility can enable and disable
Device Tree use, as well as toggling the I2C and SPI interfaces. Note that it
is possible to both enable an interface and blacklist the driver, if for some
reason you should want to defer the loading.

Modules
=======

As well as describing the hardware, Device Tree also gives enough information
to allow suitable driver modules to be located and loaded, with the corollary
that unneeded modules are not loaded. As a result it should be possible to
remove lines from /etc/modules, and /etc/modprobe.d/raspi-blacklist.conf can
have its contents deleted (or commented out).

Using Overlays
==============

Overlays are loaded using the "dtoverlay" directive. As an example, consider
the popular lirc-rpi module, the Linux Infrared Remote Control driver. In the
pre-DT world this would be loaded from /etc/modules, with an explicit
"modprobe lirc-rpi" command, or programmatically by lircd. With DT enabled,
this becomes a line in config.txt:

    dtoverlay=lirc-rpi

This causes the file /boot/overlays/lirc-rpi.dtbo to be loaded. By
default it will use GPIOs 17 (out) and 18 (in), but this can be modified using
DT parameters:

    dtoverlay=lirc-rpi,gpio_out_pin=17,gpio_in_pin=13

Parameters always have default values, although in some cases (e.g. "w1-gpio")
it is necessary to provided multiple overlays in order to get the desired
behaviour. See the list of overlays below for a description of the parameters
and their defaults.

                                N.B. For Pi3 see pi3-act-led overlay.

        act_led_gpio            Set which GPIO to use for the activity LED
                                (in case you want to connect it to an external
                                device)
                                (default "16" on a non-Plus board, "47" on a
                                Plus or Pi 2)
                                N.B. For Pi3 see pi3-act-led overlay.

        pwr_led_trigger

                                Not available on Model A/B boards.

        N.B. It is recommended to only enable those interfaces that are needed.
        Leaving all interfaces enabled can lead to unwanted behaviour (i2c_vc
        interfering with Pi Camera, I2S and SPI hogging GPIO pins, etc.)
        Note also that i2c, i2c_arm and i2c_vc are aliases for the physical
        interfaces i2c0 and i2c1. Use of the numeric variants is still possible
        but deprecated because the ARM/VC assignments differ between board
        revisions. The same board-specific mapping applies to i2c_baudrate,
        and the other i2c baudrate parameters.

Info:   Use GPIO pin as rc-core style infrared receiver input. The rc-core-

        /dev/input/event* device, all decoding is done by the kernel - LIRC is
        not required! The key mapping and other decoding parameters can be
        configured by "ir-keytable" tool.
Load:   dtoverlay=gpio-ir,<param>=<val>
Params: gpio_pin                Input pin number. Default is 18.

        active_low              Set if the power control device requires a
                                high->low transition to trigger a power-down.
                                Note that this will require the support of a
                                custom dt-blob.bin to prevent a power-down
                                during the boot process, and that a reboot
                                will also cause the pin to go low.


Name:   gpio-shutdown
Info:   Initiates a shutdown when GPIO pin changes. The given GPIO pin
        is configured as an input key that generates KEY_POWER events.
        This event is handled by systemd-logind by initiating a
        shutdown. Systemd versions older than 225 need an udev rule
        enable listening to the input device:

                ACTION!="REMOVE", SUBSYSTEM=="input", KERNEL=="event*", \
                        SUBSYSTEMS=="platform", DRIVERS=="gpio-keys", \
                        ATTRS{keys}=="116", TAG+="power-switch"

        This overlay only handles shutdown. After shutdown, the system
        can be powered up again by driving GPIO3 low. The default
        configuration uses GPIO3 with a pullup, so if you connect a
        button between GPIO3 and GND (pin 5 and 6 on the 40-pin header),
        you get a shutdown and power-up button.
Load:   dtoverlay=gpio-shutdown,<param>=<val>
Params: gpio_pin                GPIO pin to trigger on (default 3)

        active_low              When this is 1 (active low), a falling
                                edge generates a key down event and a
                                rising edge generates a key up event.
                                When this is 0 (active high), this is
                                reversed. The default is 1 (active low).

        gpio_pull               Desired pull-up/down state (off, down, up)
                                Default is "up".

                                Note that the default pin (GPIO3) has an
                                external pullup.

Name:   pi3-act-led
Info:   Pi3 uses a GPIO expander to drive the LEDs which can only be accessed
        from the VPU. There is a special driver for this with a separate DT
        node, which has the unfortunate consequence of breaking the
        act_led_gpio and act_led_activelow dtparams.
        This overlay changes the GPIO controller back to the standard one and
        restores the dtparams.

        N.B. It is also necessary to edit /lib/systemd/system/hciuart.service
        and replace ttyAMA0 with ttyS0, unless you have a system with udev rules
        that create /dev/serial0 and /dev/serial1, in which case use
        /dev/serial1 instead because it will always be correct. Furthermore,
        you must also set core_freq=250 in config.txt or the miniuart will not

          PWM1: 13,4(Alt0) 19,2(Alt5) 41,4(Alt0) 45,4(Alt0) 53,5(Alt1)
        N.B.:
          1) Pin 18 is the only one available on all platforms, and
             it is the one used by the I2S audio interface.
             Pins 12 and 13 might be better choices on an A+, B+ or Pi2.
          2) The onboard analogue audio output uses both PWM channels.
          3) So be careful mixing audio and PWM.
          4) Currently the clock must have been enabled and configured
             by other means.

Troubleshooting
===============

If you are experiencing problems that you think are DT-related, enable DT
diagnostic output by adding this to /boot/config.txt:

    dtdebug=on

and rebooting. Then run:

    sudo vcdbg log msg

and look for relevant messages.
