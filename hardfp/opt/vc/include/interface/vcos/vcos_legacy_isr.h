  * New code should use the single-dispatch scheme - the LISR/HISR
  * distinction is not necessary.

  * Under ThreadX, a HISR is implemented as a high-priority thread which 
  * waits on a counting semaphore to call the HISR function. Although this
  * provides a good approximation to the Nucleus semantics, it is potentially
  * slow if all you are trying to do is to wake a thread from LISR context.
