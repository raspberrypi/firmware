 * Packet-like messages, based loosely on those found in TRIPOS and
 * derivatives thereof.
 *
 * A task can send a message *pointer* to another task, where it is
 * queued on a linked list and the task woken up. The receiving task
 * consumes all of the messages on its input queue, and optionally
 * sends back replies using the original message memory.
 *
 * A caller can wait for the reply to a specific message - any other
 * messages that arrive in the meantime are queued separately.
 *
 *
 * All messages have a standard common layout, but the payload area can
 * be used freely to extend this.
