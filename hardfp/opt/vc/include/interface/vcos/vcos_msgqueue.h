VCOS - packet-like messages, based loosely on those found in TRIPOS.

In the simple case, only the server thread creates a message queue, and
clients wait for replies on a semaphore. In more complex cases, clients can
also create message queues (not yet implemented).

Although it's possible for a thread to create multiple queues and listen
on them in turn, if you find yourself doing this it's probably a bug.

 * Packet-like messages, based loosely on those found in TRIPOS and
 * derivatives thereof.
 *
 * A task can send a message *pointer* to another task, where it is
 * queued on a linked list and the task woken up. The receiving task
 * consumes all of the messages on its input queue, and optionally
 * sends back replies using the original message memory.
 *
 * A caller can wait for the reply to a specific message - any other
 * messages that arrive in the meantime are queued separately.
 *
 *
 * All messages have a standard common layout, but the payload area can
 * be used freely to extend this.
