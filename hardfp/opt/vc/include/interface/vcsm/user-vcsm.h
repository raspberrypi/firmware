/* VideoCore Shared Memory - user interface library.
**
** This library provides all the necessary abstraction for any application to
** make use of the shared memory service which is distributed across a kernel
** driver and a videocore service.
**
** It is an application design decision to choose or not to use this service.
**
** The logical flow of operations that a user application needs to follow when
** using this service is:
**
**       1) Initialize the service.
**       2) Allocate shared memory blocks.
**       3) Start using the allocated blocks.
**          - In order to gain ownership on a block, lock the allocated block,
**            locking a block returns a valid address that the user application
**            can access.
**          - When finished with using the block for the current execution cycle
**            or function, and so when giving up the ownership, unlock the block.
**       4) A block can be locked/unlocked as many times required - within or outside
**          of - a specific execution context.
**       5) To completely release an allocated block, free it.
**       6) If the service is no longer required, terminate it.
**
**
** Some generic considerations:

** Allocating memory blocks.
**
**   Memory blocks can be allocated in different manners depending on the cache
**   behavior desired.  A given block can either be:

**       - Allocated in a non cached fashion all the way through host and videocore.
**       - Allocated in a cached fashion on host OR videocore.
**       - Allocated in a cached fashion on host AND videocore.
**
**   It is an application decision to determine how to allocate a block.  Evidently
**   if the application will be doing substantial read/write accesses to a given block,
**   it is recommended to allocate the block at least in a 'host cached' fashion for
**   better results.
**
**
** Locking memory blocks.
**
**   When the memory block has been allocated in a host cached fashion, locking the
**   memory block (and so taking ownership of it) will trigger a cache invalidation.
**
**   For the above reason and when using host cached allocation, it is important that
**   an application properly implements the lock/unlock mechanism to ensure cache will
**   stay coherent, otherwise there is no guarantee it will at all be.
**
**   It is possible to dynamically change the host cache behavior (ie cached or non
**   cached) of a given allocation without needing to free and re-allocate the block.
**   This feature can be useful for such application which requires access to the block
**   only at certain times and not otherwise.  By changing the cache behavior dynamically
**   the application can optimize performances for a given duration of use.
**   Such dynamic cache behavior remapping only applies to host cache and not videocore
**   cache.  If one requires to change the videocore cache behavior, then a new block
**   must be created to replace the old one.
**
**   On successful locking, a valid pointer is returned that the application can use
**   to access to data inside the block.  There is no guarantee that the pointer will
**   stay valid following the unlock action corresponding to this lock.
**
**
** Unocking memory blocks.
**
**   When the memory block has been allocated in a host cached fashion, unlocking the
**   memory block (and so forgiving its ownership) will trigger a cache flush unless
**   explicitely asked not to flush the cache for performances reasons.
**
**   For the above reason and when using host cached allocation, it is important that
**   an application properly implements the lock/unlock mechanism to ensure cache will
**   stay coherent, otherwise there is no guarantee it will at all be.
**
**
** A complete API is defined below.
