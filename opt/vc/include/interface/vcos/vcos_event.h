  * An event is akin to the Win32 auto-reset event.
  *
  *
  * Signalling an event will wake up one waiting thread only. Once one
  * thread has been woken the event atomically returns to the unsignalled
  * state.
  * 
  * If no threads are waiting on the event when it is signalled it remains
  * signalled.
  *
  * This is almost, but not quite, completely unlike the "event flags"
  * object based on Nucleus event groups and ThreadX event flags.
  *
  * In particular, it should be similar in speed to a semaphore, unlike
  * the event flags.
