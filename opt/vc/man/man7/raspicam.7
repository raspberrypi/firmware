.TH RASPICAM 7
.
.SH NAME
raspicam \- the Raspberry Pi Camera Module and its utilities
.
.
.SH DESCRIPTION
.
There are four applications provided:
.BR raspistill (1),
.BR raspivid (1),
.BR raspiyuv (1)
and
.BR raspividyuv (1).
.BR raspistill (1)
and
.BR raspiyuv (1)
are very similar and are intended for capturing images;
.BR raspivid (1)
and
.BR raspvidyuv (1)
are for recording video.
The utilities share many common options, which are documented in the sections
.BR "HARDWARE OPTIONS" ,
.BR "PREVIEW OPTIONS" ,
.BR "IMAGE OPTIONS" ,
and
.BR "STEREOSCOPIC (3D) OPTIONS"
below. Within each section, options are listed alphabetically (by the
long-option's title).
.PP
All the applications are driven from the command line, and written to take
advantage of the MMAL API which runs over OpenMAX. The MMAL API provides an
easier to use system than that presented by OpenMAX. Note that MMAL is a
Broadcom-specific API used only on VideoCore 4 systems.
.PP
The applications use up to four OpenMAX (MMAL) components: camera, preview,
encoder, and null_sink. All applications use the camera component;
.BR raspistill (1)
uses the Image Encode component;
.BR raspivid (1)
uses the Video Encode component; and
.BR raspiyuv (1)
and
.BR raspividyuv (1)
don't use an encoder, sending their YUV or RGB output directly from the
camera component to file.
.PP
The preview display is optional, but can be used full-screen or directed to a
specific rectangular area on the display. If preview is disabled, the null_sink
component is used to 'absorb' the preview frames. The camera must produce
preview frames even if these aren't required for display, as they're used for
calculating exposure and white balance settings.
.PP
In addition, it's possible to omit the filename option (in which case the
preview is displayed but no file is written), or to redirect all output to
stdout.
.
.
.SH GETTING STARTED
.
.B Warning:
Cameras are sensitive to static. Earth yourself prior to handling the PCB. A
sink tap or similar should suffice if you donâ€™t have an earthing strap.
.PP
The camera board attaches to the Raspberry Pi via a 15-way ribbon cable. There
are only two connections to make: the ribbon cable needs to be attached to the
camera PCB, and to the Raspberry Pi itself. You need to get the cable the right
way round, or the camera will not work. On the camera PCB, the blue backing on
the cable should face away from the PCB, and on the Raspberry Pi it should face
towards the Ethernet connection (or where the Ethernet connector would be if
you're using a model A+).
.PP
Although the connectors on the PCB and the Pi are different, they work in a
similar way. On the Raspberry Pi itself, pull up the tabs on each end of the
connector. It should slide up easily, and be able to pivot around slightly.
Fully insert the ribbon cable into the slot, ensuring it is set straight, then
gently press down the tabs to clip it into place. The camera PCB connector also
requires you to pull the tabs away from the board, gently insert the cable,
then push the tabs back. The PCB connector can be a little more awkward than
the one on the Pi itself.
.
.
.SH TROUBLESHOOTING
.
If the Camera Module isn't working correctly, there are number of things to
try:
.IP \(bu 2
Is the ribbon cable attached to the Camera Serial Interface (CSI), not the
Display Serial Interface (DSI)? The ribbon connector will fit into either port.
The Camera port is located near the HDMI connector.
.
.IP \(bu
Are the ribbon connectors all firmly seated, and are they the right way round?
They must be straight in their sockets.
.
.IP \(bu
Is the Camera Module connector, between the smaller black Camera Module itself
and the PCB, firmly attached? Sometimes this connection can come loose during
transit or when putting the Camera Module in a case. Using a fingernail, flip
up the connector on the PCB, then reconnect it with gentle pressure. It engages
with a very slight click. Don't force it; if it doesn't engage, it's probably
slightly misaligned.
.
.IP \(bu
Have
.I sudo apt update
and
.I sudo apt full-upgrade
been run?
.
.IP \(bu
Is
.I start_x=1
present in the \(lqconfig.txt\(rq boot configuration?
.
.IP \(bu
Is your power supply sufficient? The Camera Module adds about 200-250mA to the
power requirements of your Raspberry Pi.
.
.PP
Try the following in response to specific error messages:
.
.TP
.B Error : raspistill/raspivid command not found
This probably means your update/upgrade failed in some way. Try it again.
.
.TP
.B Error : ENOMEM
The Camera Module is not starting up. Check all connections again.
.
.TP
.B Error : ENOSPC
The Camera Module is probably running out of GPU memory. Check
\(lqconfig.txt\(rq on the boot partition. The
.I gpu_mem
option should be at least 128.
.

* For frame rates over 120fps, it is necessary to turn off automatic exposure
and gain control using
.IR "-ex off" .
Doing so should achieve the higher frame rates, but exposure time and gains
will need to be set to fixed values supplied by the user.

.BR \-dn ", " \-\-dispnum " \fIscreen\fR"
Specifies which display the camera preview should appear on, using dispmanx /
tvservice numbering (see the output of

.TP
.BR \-awbg ", " \-\-awbgains " \fIblue,red\fR"
Sets blue and red gains (as floating point numbers) to be applied when
.I \-awb off
is set e.g.
.I \-awbg 1.5,1.2
.
.TP
.BR \-br ", " \-\-brightness " \fIvalue\fR"
Sets the brightness of the image, from 0 to 100. 50 is the default.
.
.TP
.BR \-cfx ", " \-\-colfx " \fIu:v\fR"
The supplied U and V parameters (range 0 - 255) are applied to the U and Y
channels of the image. For example,
.I \-\-colfx 128:128
should result in a monochrome image.
.
.TP
.BR \-co ", " \-\-contrast " \fIvalue\fR"

.
.TP
.BR \-dg ", " \-\-digitalgain " \fIvalue\fR"
Sets the digital gain value applied by the ISP (floating point value from 1.0
to 64.0, but values over about 4.0 will produce overexposed images).
.
.TP
.BR \-drc ", " \-\-drc " \fIvalue\fR"
Dynamic range control (DRC) changes the images by increasing the range of dark
areas, and decreasing the brighter areas. This can improve the image in low
light areas. Valid values are
.IR off " (default), " low ", " med ", or " high.
.
.TP
.BR \-ev ", " \-\-ev " \fIvalue\fR"
Sets the exposure value compensation, from -10 to 10. 0 is the default.

.RE
.IP
Note that not all of these settings may be implemented, depending on camera
tuning.
.
.TP
.BR \-fli ", " \-\-flicker " \fImode\fR"
Set a mode to compensate for lights flickering at the mains frequency, which
can be seen as a dark horizontal band across an image. Flicker avoidance locks
the exposure time to a multiple of the mains flicker frequency (8.33ms for
60Hz, or 10ms for 50Hz). This means that images can be noisier as the control
algorithm has to increase the gain instead of exposure time should it wish for
an intermediate exposure value.
.I auto
can be confused by external factors, therefore it is preferable to leave this
setting off unless actually required.
.IP
Possible options are:
.RS
.TP

set a ROI at halfway across and down the sensor, and a width and height of a
quarter of the sensor, use:
