Build the test apps, by entering each test app directory and run make. E.g.
  cd hello_world
  make
  ./hello_world.bin


To cross compile the apps (build on a different PC to the R-Pi), run 
  . cross_compile

to set the environment variables necessary, then follow instructions for building on the R-Pi.
SDKSTAGE should point to a root fs containing the include files and libraries from thr R-Pi.
CC should point to an ARM gcc compiler (e.g. bcm2708-gcc).
